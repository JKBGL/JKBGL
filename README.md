  ### Hello, I'm Jakatebel! Fancy meeting you here!
  I don't know why you might be interested in my Github account, but hope you get a nice read out of it!<br><br>
  I am a professional software engineer developing enterprise business applications.<br>
  I have no interest in making big public projects for the time being and as such most of my github profile is private. (*maybe in the future?*)<br>
  The reason for my drastic turn to closed source is mostly due to third party disrespect.<br>

  Some of my personal projects include several web applications like:<br>
  [Soundlib](https://soundlib.jkbgl.net), [Imagelib](https://img.jkbgl.net), [#10485](https://osu.jkbgl.net) and a lot (*a lot*) more.<br>

  As goes for interests: I like playing games, enjoy watching anime and playing games like most others do.<br>
  I also own quite a bit of infrastructure you might already be using (*not saying what it is though*)!<br><br>
  My favourite language is C++, next up is Python and then there goes PHP which was used for a lot of my earlier web projects and services.<br>
  I enjoy tackling challenges head on and given the time I overcome all of them.<br>

## Project Descriptions:

### Soundlib
Soundlib is a Music Archiving / Sharing platform (and of course that was not it's original intention at first..)
At first it was supposed to be a sort of copy of Soundcloud, and has since kind of become its own thing as
it was part of a dare I did around 2019 to try immitating big services like YouTube, Twitch, Soundcloud, Spotify, Amazon and others.
It was 5th in that series and right before it was the Imagelib (*more on that below!*)<br>
As the Soundlib contains material of questinable usage permissions I will go on record and say that I don't condone piracy *if you have the resources* and I don't support usage of copyright for malicious purposes (and as such I am not putting ads anywhere around my *"sensitive"* plaforms.)
Soundlib is primarily for archiving and trying to spread obscure music that is difficult to obtain around.

### Imagelib
Imagelib is an image sharing service much like imgur or whatever lightshot did back in the day.
It allows uploading images without an account for usage across forum threads and where image hosting is needed.
It was part 4 of the grand collection of my *"personal internet of things"* collection.

### #10,485
What a weird name you might say? - You have been understood.
10485 is a game server for the popular rythm game osu! It runs on a custom software named snowfox using the latest of python 3.10
As people who might have mentioned after taking a look around, I am a big fan of foxes! >///<

### mpp
MPP or Mania Performance Popper is an attempt of mine to write a fast performance and game difficulty calculating program for a gamemode of osu! called osu!mania (a gamemode which includes piano tiles or guitar hero-like gameplay)
It features usage of C++17 and 20 features, a lot of crazy optimizations and it's blazing fast speed enables it to process charts more than 14k lines long in 1.8ms!
I'm quite proud of it though more improvements could be made with it..
